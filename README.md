## Model Architecture

The autism detection model uses a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) with the following architecture:

```
Input Layer: 224x224x3 (RGB Image)
↓
Block 1: Conv2D(64) → Conv2D(64) → BatchNorm → MaxPool → Dropout(0.25)
Block 2: Conv2D(128) → Conv2D(128) → BatchNorm → MaxPool → Dropout(0.25)
Block 3: Conv2D(256) × 3 → BatchNorm → MaxPool → Dropout(0.25)
Block 4: Conv2D(512) × 3 → BatchNorm → MaxPool → Dropout(0.25)
↓
Flatten
↓
Dense(512) → BatchNorm → Dropout(0.5)
Dense(256) → BatchNorm → Dropout(0.5)
Dense(128) → Dropout(0.3)
Dense(1, Sigmoid) → Output (Binary Classification)
```

## Feature Analysis

The model extracts the following facial features:

1. **Eye Contact**: Ratio of detected eyes to expected
2. **Facial Symmetry**: Left-right symmetry analysis
3. **Expression Intensity**: Edge-based expression detection
4. **Face Positioning**: Face area relative to image
5. **Face Count**: Number of faces detected

## Training the Model

To train the model with your own dataset:

```python
from ml_model.autism_detector import AutismDetector

detector = AutismDetector()

# Prepare your data
X_train = np.array(...)  # Training images
y_train = np.array(...)  # Labels (0 or 1)
X_val = np.array(...)    # Validation images
y_val = np.array(...)    # Validation labels

# Train model
history = detector.train(
    X_train, y_train,
    X_val, y_val,
    epochs=50,
    batch_size=32
)

# Model is automatically saved
```

## Chatbot Features

The interactive chatbot provides guidance on:

- What is autism spectrum disorder?
- Early signs and indicators
- Early intervention programs
- Therapy options (ABA, speech, occupational)
- School support and IEPs
